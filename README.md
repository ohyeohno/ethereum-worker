# Ethereum worker

A scaling solution for Ethereum nodes by caching responses using Clouldflares
technologies like Argo tunnels and Cloudflare workers.

This is very similar to the official Cloudflare Ethereum Gateway service
provided by Cloudflare [here][1] but allows you to run and configure your own geth
or parity node and put it behind a global edge computing network with robust caching
facilities.

## Philosophy

Why caching and not a indexed DB?

## Try it for free

* free argo tunnels
* free workers with worker.dev
